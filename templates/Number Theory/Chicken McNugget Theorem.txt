The Chicken McNugget Theorem states that for any two relatively prime positive integers $m,n$, the greatest integer that cannot be written in the form $am + bn$ for non negative integers $a, b$ is $mn-m-n$.
A consequence of the theorem is that there are exactly (m - 1) * (n - 1) / 2 positive integers which cannot be expressed in the form $am + bn$.
