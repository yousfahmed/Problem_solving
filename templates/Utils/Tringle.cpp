/*
Heron's formula is used to find the area of a triangle that has three different sides. 
Heron's formula is written as, Area = √[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)],
 where a, b and c are the sides of the triangle, and 's' is the semi-perimeter of the triangle.

/*
Area of triangle with using coordinates is: A = (1/2) |x1(y2 − y3) + x2(y3 − y1) + x3(y1 − y2)|,
 where (x1,y1),(x2,y2), and (x3,y3) are the coordinates of vertices of triangle.
